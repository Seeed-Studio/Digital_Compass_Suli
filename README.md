3-Axis Compass module, a member of grove family uses I²C based Honeywell HMC5883L digital compass. This ASIC is equipped with high resolution HMC118X magneto-resistive sensors and a 12-bit ADC. It provides compass heading accuracy up to 1° to 2°. Signal conditioning like amplification, automatic degaussing strap drivers and offset cancellation are inbuilt. This grove module also includes a MIC5205-3.3 for power supply requirement. Hence user can connect any 3.3V to 6V DC power supply.

-----
**Note:**

This is a Suli-Compatible Library, You Should Download Suli for your platform, please refer to [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli "Suli")

If you can't find Suli for your platform, please contract us, If you can port it yourself and pull request to us, We'll be appreciated. 

***For Arduino:***

Just like you use the other Library, What's different is you should download Suli for Arduino First, remember that just put Suli for Arduino to your Arduino libraries folder.

***For non-Arduino Platform:***

For a non-Arduino platform, what you need is xxx.h and xxx.cpp(you can change it to xxx.c while your compiler can't support c++), the other files like xxx_Arduino.h and examples is for Arduino, you can just delete them.
